## KDL Server Chart

### Upgrading Chart

#### Upgrading an existing Release to a new major version

A major chart version change (like v0.15.3 -> v1.0.0) indicates that there is an incompatible breaking change needing
manual actions.

#### From 2.X to 3.X

This major version comes with the following breaking changes:

- Ingress configuration changed from *values.yaml* 
    - removed `ingress.type`
    - added `drone.ingress.annotations`, `kdlApp.ingress.annotations`, `gitea.ingress.annotations`, `minio.ingress.annotations`, `minio-console.ingress.annotations`, `userToolsOperator.ingress.annotations`

- Upgrade user-tools-operator to v0.20.0.
    - TLS secret name and Ingress annotations are now received from the operator values

- Upgrade app to 1.16.0
    - pass the name of the TLS secret and Ingress annotations through `userTools` resources.
    - pass Ingress annotations through `userTools`.

Run these commands to update the CRDs before applying the upgrade.

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konstellation-io/kdl-server/v3.0.0/helm/kdl-server/crds/user-tools-operator-crd.yaml
```

#### From 1.X to 2.X

This major version comes with the following breaking changes:

- This upgrades user-tools-operator to v0.17.0.
    - users service accounts are now managed by `kdlServer` instead the `user-tools-operator` 

Run these commands to update the CRDs before applying the upgrade.

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konstellation-io/kdl-server/v2.0.0/helm/kdl-server/crds/user-tools-operator-crd.yaml
```

#### From 0.X to 1.X

This major version comes with the following breaking changes:

- UserTools CRD metadata changes:
    - `metadata.name` changed to `usertools.kdl.konstellation.io`
    - `spec.groups` changed to `kdl.konstellation.io`
- KDL Runtimes support

Run these commands to update the CRDs before applying the upgrade.

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konstellation-io/kdl-server/v1.0.0/helm/kdl-server/crds/user-tools-operator-crd.yaml
```

## Development

### Dependencies

#### Microk8s

The local version of Kubernetes to deploy KDL. The version required is **1.19**.

Linux installation:

```
snap install --channel=1.19/stable microk8s --classic
```

In Mac, if the multipass vm doesn't exist the kdlctl.sh will create it automatically. You also can do it manually using:

```
source .kdlctl.conf
microk8s install --cpu ${MICROK8S_CPUS} --mem ${MICROK8S_MEMORY} --disk ${MICROK8S_DISK} --channel ${MICROK8S_CHANNEL}
```

#### Docker

Needed to build the KDL images. Installation:

https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

#### Helm

K8s package manager. Make sure you have v3+. Installation:

https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

#### gettext

OS package to fill templates during deployment. Usually it is installed in Mac and Linux.

Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install gettext
```

Mac:

```
brew install gettext
```

#### kubectl

The Kubernetes command-line tool is useful to run commands against Kubernetes clusters.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/

#### jq (Mac only)

JSON processor to configre insecure-registries on Mac.

```
brew install jq
```

## Local Environment

This repo contains a tool called `./kdlctl.sh` to handle common actions you need during development.

All the configuration needed to run KDL locally can be found in `.kdlctl.conf` file. Usually you'd be ok with the
default values. Check Microk8s parameters if you need to tweak the resources assigned to the VM (only in Mac).

Run help to get info for each command:

```
./kdlctl.sh --help

  kdlctl.sh -- a tool to manage KDL environment during development.

  syntax: kdlctl.sh <command> [options]

    commands:
      dev     creates a complete local environment.
      start   starts microk8s.
      stop    stops microk8s.
      build   calls docker to build all images and push them to microk8s registry.
      deploy  calls helm to create install/upgrade a kdl release on microk8s.
      restart restarts kdl pods or microk8s useful after build command.

    global options:
      h     prints this help.
      q     silent mode.
```

### IPV6

As chrome is having some issues with IPV6 and docker (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=974711)
before you start microk8s you need to disable IPV6 in your local machine, so when microk8s is started it is configured
without PIV6 capabilities.

To disable IPV6:

```
sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
```

### Install local environment

To install KDL in your local environment:

```
$ ./kdlctl.sh dev
```

It will install everything in the namespace specified in your development `.kdlconf` file.

### Login to local environment

In order to access the admin app, the login process can be done automatically using this script:

```
$ ./kdlctl.sh login
```

You will see an output like this:

```
Login link  : https://kdlapp.kdl.192.168.64.2.nip.io
ðŸ‘¤ User     : kdladmin
ðŸ”‘ Password : a123456
```

You can find the admin credentials `GITEA_ADMIN_USER` and `GITEA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the `.kdlctl.conf` file.

### Uninstall local environment

If you want to delete all resources generated into your microk8s run the following command:

```
$ ./kdlctl.sh uninstall
```

## Versioning lifecycle

In the development lifecycle of KLI there are three main stages depend if we are going to add a new feature, release a
new version with some features or apply a fix to a current release.

### Alphas

In order to add new features just create a feature branch from master, and after the merger the Pull Request a workflow
will run the tests and if everything passes a new alpha tag will be created (like *v0.0chore/new-relese-notes-alpha.0*), and a new release
will be generated with this tag.

### Releases

After some alpha versions we can create what we call a release, and to do that we have to run manual the Release Action.
This workflow will create a new release branch and a new tag like *v0.0.0*. With this tag, a new release will be
generated.

### Fixes

If we find out a bug in a release, we can apply a bugfix just by creating a fixed branch from the specific release
branch, and creating a Pull Request to the same release branch. When the Pull Request is merged, after passing the
tests, a new fix tag will be created just by increasing the patch number of the version, and a new release will be build
and released.

## Knowledge Galaxy

This is an external tool for data scientist that can be integrated into KDL. You can read more info about this
tool [here](https://github.com/konstellation-io/knowledge-galaxy)

To enable the integration follow these steps:

- Enable Knowledge Galaxy in `helm/values.yaml` with a config like this:

```yaml
    knowledgeGalaxy:
      enabled: true
```

- Create a secret named `regcred` with the docker credential needed in order to download the private image:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \ 
  --docker-username=$DOCKER_USERNAME \
  --docker-password=$DOCKER_AUTH_TOKEN \
   --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl -n kdl apply -f -
```

- Set the name imagePullSecret name in the `knowledgeGalaxy` config:

```yaml
    knowledgeGalaxy:
      enabled: true
      ...
      serviceaccount:
        ...
        imagePullSecrets:
          - regcred
```

### Local environment

To work with a local version of knowledge galaxy, edit your `.kdlctl.conf` file with the following information:

```bash
export KNOWLEDGE_GALAXY_LOCAL=true
export KNOWLEDGE_GALAXY_PATH=<path/to/local/knowledge-galaxy>
```

This will trigger a build whenever you use `kdlctl.sh` script.
